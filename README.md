# ExerciseTracker

ExerciseTracker is an iOS app built with **Swift** and **SwiftUI** that helps you monitor and analyze your fitness activity.  
It integrates with **Apple HealthKit** to fetch data such as steps, distance, and body mass, and displays it in charts over different time ranges.

## 🌟 Why I Built This Project

A few months ago, I decided I wanted to lose weight, but I didn’t like having to open separate health and fitness apps on my iPhone. As an iOS engineer working as an SDET, I also wanted to practice my SwiftUI skills. So, I built ExerciseTracker to have a single app where I can track calories burned, step count, distance, and even my body mass over time. It’s been a great way to streamline my own fitness journey while honing my development skills.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 Track steps, distance, and body mass  
- 📅 View activity by day, week, month, and year  
- 📈 Interactive charts with dynamic domains and labels  
- 💡 HealthKit integration for real-time fitness data  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 16.4+  
- iOS 17.6+ deployment target
